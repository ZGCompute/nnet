# nnet
 Deep fully-connected neural network, Deep Convolutional network, and Deep Recurrent network implementation using OpenCV &amp; OpenCL backend.
 
 The nnet framework was written with support for NIFTI medical imaging formats, to enable deep-learning applications development with 3D volumetric medical imaging data (MRI, CT, PET, SPECT, DWI). Provided primatives enable users to build custom CNN/RNN/FC models for classification, segmentation, and feature detection. 
 
 As of January 2018, the OpenCL backend is under heavy development. 
 
 Project inspired by homeworks in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization through deeplearning.ai and Coursera
